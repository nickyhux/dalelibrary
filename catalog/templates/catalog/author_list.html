  <h1><center>Blood & Wine in Tokyo</center></h1>
  <p><center>Plot Synopsis (first 2 seasons + S3E1) </center></p>
  <br></br>
  <br></br>
  <p><center><em>Season 1</em></center></p>  
  <p><center>Tom Mirza was born to a working-class family in Providence, Rhode Island - son of Lebansese immigrants who had come to the US to find work in the booming manufacturing industry in the city. Tom’s father found employment at the mob-run Providence Parts, which ostensibly specialized in wheel loaders, elevator slings and movable trailing edges for aircraft - however, they were, let’s say, highly flexible. Providence Parts was part of what was facetiously called at the time a “Charitable Solutions Enterprise”. When a more reputable manufacturer wouldn’t play ball with one of the Patriarca family’s business interests, Providence Parts would step in & spend exorbitant amounts of money to re-tool their machinery and mass-produce the needed part, selling it at a loss, flooding the market and forcing the aforementioned manufacturer out of business. Even though the tactic lended Providence Parts a despicable balance sheet, their partnership with the five families, and all the money they saved them scaring business partners, made Providence Parts a success.</center></p>
  <p><center>At 12 years old, Tom began helping his father out at work. He quickly became enchanted by the ever-changing dance of machinations, gaining the respect of the family by using his small-frame to masterfully fix shoddy equipment. His father knew the immense risk of his son tangling around in the machinery, but he feared the family more. He was even impressed with how quickly Tom soaked everything up.</center></p>
  <p><center>Years later, with the Patriarca family nearly dissolved, Tom took over the business. Providence Parts had long abandoned their glory days as a Charitable Solutions Enterprise and was just focusing on a couple parts. Still, with manufacturing shipping overseas, the company was on the verge of bankruptcy. In 1978, though, the deregulation of the airline industry sparked that which would make Tom a business  legend. A new & struggling airline, Luxury Air, founded by Phillip “Rusty” Rastelli of the New York Bonanno crime family, was having trouble getting a “fair price” on an order of Boeing 727-25s. The situation was, no doubt, made worse by the fact that Rusty had been locked up in Lewisburg for the past three years on racketeering charges. </center></p>
  <p><center>Knowing Providence Parts was in a bind, Rusty’s capos came to Tom with a business opportunity - for “old time’s sake”. Put Boeing out of business. The idea of putting Boeing out of business was, of course, laughable. This wasn’t Shit Stink’s metal scraps manufacturer in the middle of Woonsocket - this was fucking Boeing. And times had changed. However, Tom had long been of the opinion that aircraft production in the US was wasteful, even incompetent. He always thought that if he just had the funding, he could make better planes - 10x faster and 20x cheaper. With Rusty’s generous investment, Providence Holdings was born. </center></p>
  <p><center>Tom was the first to own his airline’s entire supply chain. They churned P-757s right out of Providence Parts and sold them all to Providence Air, ferrying them to PVD headquarters 20 minutes away and sometimes flying them fully-loaded just an hour later. Luck would have it, one of Providence’s finest was heading up the DOT at the time, and it was an ill-kept secret that the boys at the FAA had no idea what the fuck they were doing. Tom’s the expert - he can just do the inspections for us and let us know. </center></p>
  <p><center>The strategy that made Providence Holdings a success was to cut corners in production then mimic Delta’s BOS schedule 1:1 out of PVD - for $20 cheaper. “Revolutionary”, they said.</center></p>
  <p><center>Sure, there were accidents, but none more than those of the big guys. What they don’t want you to know is that everyone was doing it Tom’s way. Tom was just better at it. </center></p>
  <p><center>Providence Air quickly became a top 5 player in the industry, notorious for debaucherous parties and risque advertising tactics. Once, at a company holiday party, Tom let a drunken stewardess take a P-190 out on the runway at PVD, nearly getting annihilated by a landing 747. </center></p>
  <p><center>During this time, Tom and his wife Margaret, a well-respected psych at Rhode Island’s premier Butler hospital, gave birth to five children - Benjamin, Margaret Jr., William, Nicholas & Samuel.</center></p>
  <p><center>The kids attended the best schools Rhode Island had to offer, all graduating from the Wheeler school, but none had a close relationship with their father. They sometimes felt that of all the people acquainted with the richest man on the Island, they knew him the least. </center></p>
  <p><center>The season ends with Tom arguing on the phone with Margaret on his way to Washington to meet with his favorite elected funders, when Tom realizes he had been arguing with himself for the past 30 seconds. Margaret, sounding uncharacteristically shaken, asks Tom if he’s anywhere near a television. In the corner of the shot, you can see a newspaper with the day’s date - September 11th, 2001.</center></p>
  <br></br>
  <p><center><em>Season 2</em></center></p>
  <p><center>Even though none of Providence Air’s planes were involved in the attacks, business suffered, as no one wanted to fly on a plane owned by a guy with a middle-eastern sounding last name. Although Tom had been relatively progressive for his time, he responded by adopting a very public right-wing stance, hoping to get the public  (and more crucially, the “investing wing” of congress) back on his side. </center></p>
  <p><center>While Benjamin, Maggie & Will were already off galavanting at the north east’s various liberal-elite universities, Tom’s opportunistic, albeit persuasive, turn to conservatism had an effect on shaping Nick & Sam’s worldview, as we see by their reactions to watching their father’s fiery, now infamous, speech at the 2002 CPAC. </center></p>
  <p><center>At this point, we are launched 10 years forward, with the remainder of the season focusing on the children - mostly the three older kids vying for the company while combating their father’s lack of respect for their liberal education. We see that the only child that has fully adopted Tom’s now fanatical conservatism is the second youngest, Nick. However, Nick goes mostly unnoticed by his father. Nick is seen by his father as young and unserious, a boy who just “loves planes” but doesn’t understand the business. And who is usually more interested in doing shows with his and Sam’s band - “Jet! Blue.”</center></p>
  <p><center>During this time, we meet Nick’s on-again off-again girlfriend, Nicole, daughter of a construction worker & lover of the obscene. It is through her, that we begin to suspect we have been tricked as viewers. With Nicole’s gleeful encouragement of Nick’s worst-held takes, it becomes apparent that Nick may be putting on an absurd show to demonstrate the unreality of his family’s position. </center></p>
  <p><center>This culminates in the season finale, when we find out that Nick is in fact the unnamed source from the Time’s expose of Providence Parts’ shoddy manufacturing practices. We knew it had to be someone close to Tom, with the level of access they seemed to have, and in retrospect, Nick was the only one who knew enough about how planes are made to uncover the disintegrating wiring - and even ladders in the tail wings. </center></p>
  <p><center>We are left with an embattled Mirza family testifying in congress. When Nick is called to the stand, no one shows. </center></p>
    <br></br>
  <p><center><em>Season 3 Opener</em></center></p>
  <p><center>In the long awaited season 3 opener, we see Nicole filming Nick in Tokyo as Nick embarks on one of his usual right-wing diatribes. This time is different, though. The shots are shaky & novice - nothing like the expert cinematography we have witnessed up to this point. The theme, usually in which Nick makes only a couple appearances, is focused almost entirely on Nick & Nicole. None from the family are present, save for a shot of Sam playing in one of their shows and Nick & Will playing guitar at the end (it’s difficult to even make out that it is Will, though). </center></p>
  <p><center>In the climax of the opener, to much reddit-theorists satisfaction, Nick breaks the fourth wall, saying that he is “all out of right-wing talking points”. This confirms that for the first two seasons, we were not voyeuristically watching a modern-American magnate family. We were viewing an elaborate Providence Holdings marketing ploy. They knew they were being filmed. It turns out, Nick has been the one to watch out for the entire time. And now that he has broken free and is telling his own story, we’re sure to have an exciting season ahead of us. </center></p>
